"""
ASR adapter interface — Phase 3.3 (ROADMAP.md).

One protocol, multiple engines. Today we ship:

    • FasterWhisperBackend — CTranslate2-based (the engine WhisperX uses).
                            Default on Linux, Windows, mac-Intel. Also fast
                            on mac-ARM so we use it as the cross-platform
                            baseline and only prefer MLX on mac-ARM when
                            explicitly installed.
    • MLXWhisperBackend   — mlx-whisper on Apple Silicon. Optional speedup,
                            only available when mlx wheels install (mac-ARM).
    • PyTorchWhisperBackend — last-resort fallback using the existing
                            `_asr_pipe` on the TTS model.

Both return the raw Whisper output dict so `services.segmentation.
segment_transcript(...)` can keep working unchanged — new backends normalise
their output to the `{"chunks": [{"text", "timestamp": (start, end)}]}`
shape the segmenter expects.

Selection via `OMNIVOICE_ASR_BACKEND` (default: auto-detect, prefers
faster-whisper because it's available on every platform we ship to).

    speechbrain 1.x exposes optional integrations (``k2_fsa``, ``numba`` losses,
    ``spacy``/``flair`` nlp) as ``LazyModule`` redirects living in ``sys.modules``.
    Stray introspection — PyTorch's op-registration machinery, pickling, a
    ``dir()``/``hasattr`` walk — touches one of these during ``whisperx.load_model``
    (pyannote → speechbrain), which would *actually* import the optional package.
    speechbrain guards against that by suppressing the import when the triggering
    frame is the stdlib ``inspect`` module — but the check is
    ``filename.endswith("/inspect.py")``, a hardcoded POSIX separator. On Windows
    the frame filename uses backslashes (``...\\Lib\\inspect.py``), so the guard
    misses, the redirect imports ``speechbrain.integrations.k2_fsa`` → ``import k2``
    → k2 isn't installed → ``ImportError: Lazy import of LazyModule(...k2_fsa...)
    failed``. That bubbles out of WhisperX and aborts transcription with zero
    segments. WhisperX is the *default* ASR, so this is a Windows-only break of a
    cross-platform-default feature (P0 parity).

    Fix the whole class — every optional-integration redirect, not just k2 — by
    re-implementing ``LazyModule.ensure_module`` with an ``os.sep``-agnostic
    basename check. Idempotent and a no-op on macOS/Linux (basename match is a
    strict superset of the old forward-slash check) and when speechbrain is
