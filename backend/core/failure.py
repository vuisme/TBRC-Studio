"""Shared pipeline-failure helper (plan-04 / #131).

Single source of truth for "what a failure looks like" so every emit site —
the TaskManager worker, the dub ingest pipeline, the dub/batch routers — produces
the same structured, **non-empty**, sanitized failure event instead of its own
ad-hoc ``str(e)`` (which is empty or cryptic for many exception types, and was
the root of the "extract: unknown error" reports in #122/#63).

Guarantees:
  - ``reason`` is ALWAYS non-empty (falls back to the exception class name).
  - ``detail`` / ``diagnostic`` are sanitized: HF tokens, ``*TOKEN*/*KEY*/*SECRET*``
    env values, and absolute home paths never leak (Constitution I).
  - the 5-class docs taxonomy is reused from ``core.error_docs_map`` (not
    duplicated) so the deeplink contract stays single-sourced.

# download/load fails with a connectivity error, the raw transformers/hf_hub
# message ("We couldn't connect to 'https://hf-mirror.com' to load the files…")
# gives the user no next step. This is the single classifier for that class,
# shared by every surface: build_failure() (model status, dub/task events),
# the global 500 handler (main.py — covers /generate and every other route
# that can leak a model-load error), and the model-install SSE
# (setup/download.py).
